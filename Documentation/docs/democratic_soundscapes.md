# Democratic Sound Scapes

Concept and programming: Kristof Konya

## MVP:

- PiÂ´s can vote via OSC to a central computer that does sound generation.

- The vote consists of X and Y values that can be selected via an X-Y pad.

- All the votes get combined on the central and sound is synthesized.

- The 4 corners represent 4 synthesized sounds that get morphed on the speakers depending on the current voting.

## Improvements:

- Clients have a visual indication of the current common vote.

- Change of vote gets represented stronger than static value holding, to increase movement in soundscapes and reduce the presence of overly averaged sounds.
